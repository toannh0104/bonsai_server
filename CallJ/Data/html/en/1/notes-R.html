		The following examples show the key forms to be practised in this lesson.<br><br>
		<table align=CENTER width=600 border=1 style="margin-left: 15%;">
			<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>1</td><td>Objects vs People:</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td></td><td>Kore ha ringo desu</td><td>"This is an apple" (object)</td></tr>
			<tr><td></td><td>jyonsan ha isha desu</td><td>"John is a doctor" (person)</td></tr>
			<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>2</td><td>Question vs Statement:</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td></td><td>Kore ha orenji desu</td><td>"This is an orange?"</td></tr>
			<tr><td></td><td>Sore ha orenji desu ka</td><td>"Is that an orange?"</td></tr>
			<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>3</td><td>Positive vs Negative:</td><td></td></tr>
			<tr><td></td><td>sari-san ha igirisujin desu</td><td>"Sally is English"</td></tr>
			<tr><td></td><td>Imanishi san ha igirisujinde ha arimasen</td><td>"Imanishi  is not English"</td></tr>

		The sentence you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above.  The grammar required
		to form these sentences is covered in the text below.<br>

	<u>Grammar Point 1: Use of the -desu to explain who or what someone/something is.</u>
</P>

<P>
	<FONT SIZE=3>
	Desu can be tranlated as "is, are, am" etc.  Desu acts like a verb, in that it's form changes depending on the tense, politeness, and <br>
	sign of the sentence.  In this lesson we will only be dealing with the polite, non-past form of Desu.  However, the following table shows<br>
	the various forms of desu, and whilst this information is not required for this lesson, it may be usefull to become familiar with it now.<br><br>
	
	
	<CENTER>
	<table width = 90% border=1>
		<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF">
			<td><i>Type</i></td>
			<td><i>Plain</i></td>
			<td><i>Polite</i></td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>
			<td>Present, Positive</td>
			<td><FONT color="#666666">Da</td>
			<td>Desu (です)</td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>
			<td>Present, Negative</td>
			<td><FONT color="#666666">De wa nai</td>
			<td>De wa arimasen (ではありません)</td>

	</table>

	<FONT SIZE=3>
	Having seen the form that "desu" takes, we will now consider it's use and positioning in a sentence.  Consider the following examples:<br><br>
	
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td width = 250>"Watashi ha John <u>desu</u>"</td>
			<td>"I am John (my name is John)"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width = 250>"Kore ha keitai <u>desu</u>"</td>
			<td>"This is a mobile phone"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width = 250>"Sore ha ringo <u>de ha arimasen</u>"</td>
			<td>"That is not an apple"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width = 250>"Sore ha banana <u>desu ka</u>"</td>
			<td>"Is that a banana?"</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<BR>
	<FONT SIZE=3>
	Notes:<br>
	- Desu, in whatever form, is used at the end of the sentence.  <br>
	- In the above sentences, "ha" is used as the topic marker, ie. the object that we are talking about.<br>
	- Sore and Kore are both pronouns, meaning "That" and "This" respecitively.  See the next section for more information.<br>
	- In the last example, we can see that to form a question we simply add ka? to the end of the sentence.<br>

		<u>Grammar Point 2: "ha" and "mo"</u>
	</P>
	<P>
		<FONT SIZE=3>
		"Ha" (pronounced wa) is used to mark the subject of a sentence, and follows directly after the subject.  For example:<br><br>
		Kore ha ringo desu - "This is an apple"<br><br>
		In this case, "This"(kore) is the subject of the sentence.<br><br><br>
		"Mo" is used in the sense of "also", and may also be placed after the subject, replacing "Ha".  For example:<br><br>
		Kore mo ringo desu - "This is also an apple"<br><br>
		In this case, "This" is still the subject of the sentence, but the meaning now implies "also", as in that there
		is another object that the subject is being equated to.<br><br>

		<u>Grammar Point 3: Demonstratives</u>
	</P>
	<P>
		<FONT SIZE=3>
		Demonstatives are the words such as "This", "that", etc.  For this lesson, we will be considering the<br>
		following 4 words:　kore、sore、are and dore.  Which word is to be use depends on the location of the<br>
		object being referred to by the word with regards to the speaker and the listener.  This is shown in the<br>
		following table (S=Speaker, L=Listener):<br><br>
		
	</P>
	<table width = 90% border=1>
		<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF">
			<td><i>Japanese</i></td>
			<td><i>English</i></td>
			<td><i>Object Location</i></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Kore</td>
			<td>This</td>
			<td>Nearer S than L</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Sore</td>
			<td>That</td>
			<td>Nearer L　than S</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Are</td>
			<td>That (over there)</td>
			<td>Away from both L & S</td>
		</tr>
	</table><br>
	Dore is a little bit different as it is a question word which could be translated as "which".  There are other constructs<br>
	which follow the same pattern as the above (kono, sono, ano; kochira, sochira, achira etc), but these will be covered in<br>
	a later lesson.
