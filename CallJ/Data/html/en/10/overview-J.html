<p><i>"I am drinking."</i><br>
Using the "て" form of the verb plus "いる" to express states and progressive actions</p></b>
<p>In this lesson we will practise making statements about states and progressive actions. These sentences use the "て" form of the verb plus the auxiliary verb "いる", and are similar to the pattern "be doing" in English.</p>
<p>We will also considering making sentences in both polite and plain forms. Two main forms to be practised in this lesson can be summarised by the following examples.</p>
