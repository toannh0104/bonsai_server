<p><u>Key Forms:</u></p>
<p>The following examples show the key forms to be practised in this lesson.</p>

<p>The sentences you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above. The grammar required to form these sentences is covered in the text below.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<p><u>Grammar Point 1: Going somewhere to do an action</u></p>
<p>In this lesson, we will learn an expression used when a subject goes somewhere to perform an action. It is similar to the English expressions "go out for X" or "go to X to Y", and consists of a direct object marked by the direct object marker "wo" followed by the stem form of a verb plus the phrase "ni ikimasu". Note that this type of sentence is only used to indicate the purpose if that purpose is relatively unimportant or simple. It is often used for simple actions such as eating or shopping, but cannot be used when the action is complicated or very important to the subject. Optionally, the destination followed by the direction marker "ni" or "he" may appear at the beginning of the sentence, but this is not necessary in this lesson. Study the following examples.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>本を借りに行きます - "I will go to borrow a book."</p>
<p>ケーキを食べに行きます - "I will go to eat cake."</p>
<p>くつを買いに行きます - "I will go to buy shoes."</p>
<p><u>Grammar Point 2: The stem form of verbs</u></p>
<p>The stem form of the verb is used by the grammar pattern above, but also appears in other expressions. Different groups of verbs have different rules for creating the stem form, as explained below.</p>
<p>Group 1: Replace the final "u" sound with "i".</p>
<p>Group 2: Simply drop the final "ru" sound from the verb.</p>
<p>Group 3: No particular rule exists, so the stem forms must be learnt.</p>
