In this lesson we will practise grammar patterns used to express whether an event has already happened or not. まだ is used to show that an action is still ongoing, or that an event has not yet happened. In contrast, もう is used to show that an event has already occurred or than an action has finished. Finally, the expression までに can be used to show that an event will be completed before a certain time. All of these expressions can be used with both volitional actions initiated by the speaker or events outside of the speaker's control.
