Conditional statements</p></b>
<p>In this lesson we will practise sentences with conditional clauses. We will look at various phrases which can be used to mark a clause as conditional and attach it to a sentence, and the different nuances that these words carry. In this lesson you will be given two pictures, one depicting the conditional clause and the other depicting the sentence, and asked to choose the the correct grammar pattern to connect them. The main forms to be practised in this lesson are summarised by the following examples.</p>
<table align="center" width="600" border="1" style="margin-left: 15%;">
