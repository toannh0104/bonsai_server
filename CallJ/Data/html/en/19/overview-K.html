<p><b><i>"I will try this."</i></b><br>
<b>Intentional actions</b></p>
<p>This lesson will introduce various verbs which modify a sentence to indicate why an action was performed or the speaker's feelings on the outcome. First, it introduces a form which is used to show the speaker's desire to perform an action at some point in the future. Next, we will practise an expression used to show that an action is done in preparation for a future event. Finally, an expression that shows regret over an unintentional outcome is introduced.</p>
