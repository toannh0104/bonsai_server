<p>The sentences you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above.  The grammar required to form these sentences is covered in the text below.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<p><u>Grammar Point 1: Verbs</u></p>
<p>There are 3 groups of verbs, and the manner in which a verb changes form depends on which group it is in. There are numerous group 1 and group 2 verbs, and within each group the rules for expanding the verbs may be easily defined. Group 3 consists of those few verbs that do not follow the rules so closely, and are dealt with separately.</p>
<p>In this lesson we will be using verbs in the polite and plain (dictionary) form, and will be considering the verb in both positive and negative forms. We will also be using the verb in its past and non-past forms. Thus, by considering the combinations of the above choices, we are looking at 8 possible forms. The following sections cover each form in turn, showing how the form is constructed for each verb group, giving examples.</p>
<p>1.1 Dictionary Form</p>
<p>The plain, non-negative, non-past form of a verb may be known as its dictionary form. It is in this form that we will give verbs in the dictionary, and it is also this form that a hint for a verb will display before displaying the verbs true form (for a given sentence). The following table shows a few examples of verbs in the dictionary form across the 3 groups:</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>Group</td><td>Dictionary Form</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td width="30">1</td><td>s‚­</td><td>To Go</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ˆù‚Ş</td><td>To Drink</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>—V‚Ô</td><td>To Play</td></tr><tr><td width="30">2</td><td>Q‚é</td><td>To Sleep</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>H‚×‚é</td><td>To Eat</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Œ©‚é</td><td>To See / Watch</td></tr><tr><td width="30">3</td><td>‚·‚é</td><td>To Do</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>—ˆ‚é</td><td>To Come</td></tr>
</table>
<p>1.2 Polite Form</p>
<p>As covered above, the dictionary form expresses the verb in a plain, non-negative, non-past sense. We will now look at the polite form of the verb, often referred to as the "Masu Form". This form is also non-negative, and non-past. The forming of the polite form varies on the group of the verb, as shown in the following table:</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Group</td><td>Dictionary Form</td><td>Polite Form</td><td>Method</td></tr><tr><td width="30">1</td><td>s‚­</td><td>s‚«‚Ü‚·</td><td>The polite form of the verb is formed by removing the final ‚¤ sound from the dictionary form, and replacing it with ‚¢‚Ü‚· .</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ˆù‚Ş</td><td colspan="2">ˆù‚İ‚Ü‚·</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>—V‚Ô</td><td colspan="2">—V‚Ñ‚Ü‚·</td></tr><tr><td width="30">2</td><td>Q‚é</td><td>Q‚Ü‚·</td><td>The polite form of the verb is formed by removing the final ‚é sound from the dictionary form, and replacing it with ‚Ü‚· .</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>H‚×‚é</td><td colspan="2">H‚×‚Ü‚·</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Œ©‚é</td><td colspan="2">Œ©‚Ü‚·</td></tr><tr><td width="30">3</td><td>‚·‚é</td><td>‚µ‚Ü‚·</td><td>The group 3 verbs do not follow conventional rules, and thus the various forms should be learnt.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>—ˆ‚é</td><td colspan="2">—ˆ‚Ü‚·</td></tr>

<p><u>Grammar Point 2: Objects, Places, etc. </u></p>
<p>2.2 The Object</p>
<p>The direct object of a transitive verb is always marked by the object marker ‚ğ (pronounced ‚¨). For example:</p>
<p>„‚ÍƒeƒŒƒr‚ğŒ©‚Ü‚· - "I will watch TV."</p>
<p>¡’©ƒR[ƒq[‚ğˆù‚İ‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "I drank coffee this morning."</p>
<p>Transitive verbs take both a subject (which performs the action) and an object (which is acted upon), but the subject may be omitted if it has been mentioned earlier in the conversation or can be understood from context.</p>
<p><u>2.3 The Place</u></p>
<p>2.3.1 The Place where an Action is Performed</p>
<p>The location marker ‚Å is used to show the place where an action is performed in sentences with a verb.</p>
<p>}‘ŠÙ‚Å•×‹­‚µ‚Ä‚¢‚Ü‚· - "I am studying at the library."</p>
<p>Note that there are some restrictions on when "de" can be used. It can not be used in simple sentences that express the existence of a person or object with "iru" or "aru", or when expressing where a person lives with the verb "sumu". In these cases, the direction marker "ni" must be used.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>—é–Ø‚³‚ñ‚Í‹“s‚É‚¢‚Ü‚· - "Suzuki is in Kyoto."</p>
<p>“Œ‹‚ÉZ‚ñ‚Å‚¢‚Ü‚·‚© - "Do you live in Tokyo?"</p>
<p>These special cases will be explained more in later lessons.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Place as a Direction</p>
<p>The direction markers ‚É and ‚Ö (pronounced ‚¦) are used to show the direction or destination of a movement verb such as "to come" or "to go". In this usage, ‚É and ‚Ö are generally equivalent and either one can be used.</p>
<p>–¾“ú„‚Í“Œ‹‚És‚«‚Ü‚· - "I will go to Tokyo tomorrow."</p>
<p>“c’†‚³‚ñ‚ÍŠwZ‚És‚«‚Ü‚· - "Tanaka will go to school."</p>
