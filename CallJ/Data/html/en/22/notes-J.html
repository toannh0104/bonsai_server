<p>The sentences you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above. The grammar required to form these sentences is covered in the text below.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 1: Giving</b></u></p>
<p>The verb あげる is used to indicate that one person gives an object to someone else. The giver is marked with the topic marker は , the recipient is marked with the direction marker に , and the object given is marked with the direct object marker を . The focus of the sentence is placed on the giver.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Past</td></tr><tr><td>私は田中さんに本をあげました - "I gave Tanaka a book." (polite)</td></tr><tr><td>鈴木さんはトムさんにリンゴをあげた - "Suzuki gave Tom an apple." (plain)</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Non-Past</td></tr><tr><td>トムさんは田中さんにエンピツをあげます - "Tom will give Tanaka a pencil." (polite)</td></tr><tr><td>私は鈴木さんにバナナをあげる - "I will give Suzuki a banana." (plain)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This word cannot be used if you are the recipient, or if you or a member of your family is the recipient and someone outside your family is the giver. See Grammar Point 2 below for an explanation of this case.</p>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 2: Giving when you or your family is the recipient</b></u></p>
<p>In the last grammar point it was mentioned that there are certain circumstances under which あげる cannot be used. Specifically, if the giver is someone outside your family and you (or your family members) are the recipient, you must use the verb くれる instead. </p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Rules for when to use くれる</td></tr><tr><td>1. When you are the recipient</td></tr><tr><td>2. When you or your family members are the recipient and the giver is someone outside your family</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This verb has the same meaning as あげる in these situations, but clearly states that you (or one of your family members) is the recipient. In Japanese, a distinction is made between one's group (such as family) and others. This should be clear if you study the examples below.</p>
<p>In the first two examples the giver is someone outside the speaker's family so くれる is used. </p>
<p>田中さんが私にプレゼントをくれました - "Tanaka gave me a present." (polite)</p>
<p>先生がリンゴを弟にくれた - "The teacher gave my younger brother an apple." (plain)</p>
<p>The next two examples illustrate how the rules are applied. In the first sentence, because the speaker is the recipient くれる must be used. In the second sentence, the recipient is a family member but so is the giver, so あげる is used. This case is the same as the example in Grammar Point 1 where both the giver and receiver are third parties not in the speaker's family.</p>
<p>姉が私に本をくれます - "My older sister will give me a book."</p>
<p>姉が弟に本をあげました - "My older sister gave my younger brother a book."</p>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 3: Receiving</b></u></p>
<p>The verb もらう is used to indicate that one person receives an object from someone else. In this case, the focus of the sentence is placed on the receiver. This word cannot be used if you are the giver. The recipient is marked with the topic marker は , the giver is marked with the direction marker に , and the object that is received is marked with the direct object marker を . </p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Past</td></tr><tr><td>私は田中さんに本をもらった - "I received a book from Tanaka." (plain)</td></tr><tr><td>鈴木さんはトムさんにコーラをもらいました - "Suzuki received some cola from Tom." (polite)</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Non-past</td></tr><tr><td>トムさんは友達にコーラをもらう - "Tom will receive some cola from his friend." (plain)</td></tr><tr><td>私は兄に雑誌をもらいます - "I will receive a magazine from my older brother." (polite)</td></tr>
