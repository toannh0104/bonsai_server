<p><b><i>"Tom gave John a book."</i></b><br>
<b>How to express the concept of giving and receiving</b></p>
<p>In this lesson we will look at how to form sentences that convey the meaning of giving and receiving. There are a number of different verbs that are used for this - which verb should be used depends on the situation, the focus (subject) of the sentence, and the relative seniority level between the two people. Please refer to the notes for further information. The following table shows the kind of answers you will be expected to give throughout the lesson:</p>
