		The sentence you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above.  The grammar required
		to form these sentences is covered in the text below.<br>

<BR><HR><p><u><b>Grammar Point 1: Volitional decisions to perform actions</b></u></p>
<p>This grammar pattern is used when the speaker makes a volitional decision to do something. By adding ことにする to a subordinate clause that ends with a verb in the plain, non-past form the speaker indicates that he has made a decision to perform the action described in the clause.</p>
<p>映画を見ることにしました。   "I decided to watch a movie."</p>
<p>京都に行くことにした。	     "I decided to go to Kyoto."</p>
<p>Negating the verb indicates that the speaker has decided not to perform the action.</p>
<p>明日学校に行かないことにした。	  "I decided not to go to school tomorrow."</p>
<p>その本を買わないことにしました。  "I decided not to buy that book."</p>
<p>Note that this grammar pattern can only be used when the subordinate clause describes a volitional action by the speaker, so verbs and clauses that do not fit this restriction are not possible.</p>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 2: Events that occur irregardless of the speaker's volition</b></u></p>
<p>While the previous grammar pattern is used for volitional decisions made by the speaker, the related expression ことになる is used for actions that happen because of something outside of the speaker's control. The nuance is that events have unfolded irregardless of the speaker's volition. The most common use of this expression is to show the result of a decision or arrangement made by an unspecified agent.</p>
<p>東京に転勤することになりました。   "It has been decided that I will transfer to Tokyo."</p>
<p>来年イギリスを留学することになった。   "It has been arranged that I will study abroad in England next year."</p>
<p>Because this form expresses the idea that the action occurred irregardless of the speaker's volition, it is also used like the expressions 'turn out' or 'come about' in English.</p>
<p>姉と喧嘩することになった。  "I ended up fighting with my older sister."</p><BR>
