Decisions<BR></b></P>
<P>

<br>In this lesson we will practise how to express one's decision to do something. This grammar pattern is used with volitional actions performed by the speaker. We will also learn a related expression used when the speaker performs an action due to arrangements or events outside of his control. The choice between these two expressions to use is determined by whether or not the speaker made a voluntary decision. See the example sentences below for examples.
