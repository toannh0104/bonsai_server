<p>The sentences you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above. The grammar required to form these sentences is covered in the text below.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 1: The passive form</b></u></p>
<p><b>1.1 The passive form</b></p>
<p>In the sentences that we have studied up until now, the basic pattern has been that the subject is the actor who performs the action described by the verb. In the passive construction, the focus is shifted so that the subject is the person or thing acted upon. You can see the difference between these two types of sentences by comparing how they describe the same events.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Active</td></tr><tr><td>”L‚ª‹›‚ğH‚×‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "The cat ate the fish."</td></tr><tr><td>‹­“‚ª„‚ÌŠ“‚ğ“‚İ‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "A mugger stole my bag."</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Passive</td></tr><tr><td>‹›‚ª”L‚ÉH‚×‚ç‚ê‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "The fish was eaten by the cat."</td></tr><tr><td>„‚Í‹­“‚ÉŠ“‚ğ“‚Ü‚ê‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "I had my bag stolen by a mugger."</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In a passive sentence the subject marked with ‚Í or ‚ª is what is acted upon. The actor is marked with ‚É and the passive form of the verb is used. If a direct object marked with ‚ğ is present, it is acted upon by the actor, not the subject. To form the plain passive form of a verb, change the final "u" sound to "a" and add "reru" for group 1 and 2 verbs. The passive form of Group 3 verbs must be learnt. No matter what group the dictionary form is, changing a verb to the passive form always makes it a group 2 verb.</p>

<p>Compared to English, the passive construction is widely used in Japanese. Both the actor and the direct object may be omitted, either if they are understood from context or if the speaker doesn't want to go into detail. As in other sentences, the subject may be omitted as well.</p>
<p>‚±‚Ì–{‚Í‘½‚­‚Ìl‚É“Ç‚Ü‚ê‚Ä‚¢‚Ü‚· - "This book is read by many people."</p>
<p>‚æ‚­‰pŒê‚ªãè‚ÆŒ¾‚í‚ê‚Ü‚· - "I'm often told that my English is good." (subject and actor omitted)</p>
<p>‚±‚ÌŠX‚Í‚P‚O‚O”N‘O‚Éì‚ç‚ê‚½ - "This city was built 100 years ago." (actor omitted)</p>
<p><b>1.2 Expressing respect with the passive form</b></p>
<p>The passive form of a verb can also be used to show respect when describing the actions of a person of higher social status. This type of sentence is somewhat politer than normal speech but not as polite as the honorific 'keego' forms that we will study later. Unlike other sentences with the passive form, in these type of sentences the subject remains the actor and only the verb is changed to the passive form. Thus, just like a regular sentence the subject marked with ‚Í or ‚ª is the actor and the direct object marked with ‚ğ is acted upon by the subject.</p>
<p>—é–Øæ¶‚Í–{‚ğ‰½û‚à‘‚©‚ê‚Ü‚µ‚½- "Professor Suzuki has written several books."</p>
<p>‚±‚Ì–â‘è‚É‚Â‚¢‚Ä‚Ç‚¤v‚í‚ê‚Ü‚·‚© - "What do you think about this problem?"</p>
<p><b>1.3 Expressing displeasure or sympathy</b></p>
<p>The passive form can also show empathy for a subject that suffers something or express frustration caused by an unpleasant event. In the latter case, the subject is often the speaker.</p>
<p>‹›‚ª”L‚ÉH‚×‚ç‚ê‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "The fish was eaten by the cat."</p>
<p>„‚Í‰J‚É~‚ç‚ê‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "I was rained on."</p>
<p>’í‚ÉƒeƒŒƒr‚ğ‰ó‚³‚ê‚½ - "The TV was broken by my little brother."</p>
<p>A speaker might say the first example above if his pet fish was eaten, or if he felt sorry for the fish. In the second and third examples above, the subject is the speaker and these sentences express that he was inconvenienced by the outcome. Compare these with the sentences below, which merely state the facts in the active voice without using the passive to express sympathy.</p>
<p>”L‚ª‹›‚ğH‚×‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "The cat ate the fish."</p>
<p>‰J‚ª~‚è‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "It rained."</p>
<p>’í‚ªƒeƒŒƒr‚ğ‰ó‚µ‚½ - "My little brother broke a TV."</p>
<p>In terms of describing the events that happened, both sentences are identical to the original examples that use the passive form. However, the original passive examples express the speaker's unhappiness with the events, while these examples carry none of that nuance.</p>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 2: The causative passive form</b></u></p>
<p>Recall that the causative construction that we studied in the last lesson is used to express that someone is allowed to or made to do an action. This construction can be combined with the use of the passive in section 1.3 to show that someone was forced to do something and did not enjoy it or that the speaker empathises with the subject who was forced to do something. Study the examples below.</p>
<p>“c’†‚³‚ñ‚Íd–‚ğ‚â‚ß‚³‚¹‚ç‚ê‚½ - "Tanaka was forced to quit his job."</p>
<p>„‚Í•ê‚ÉƒsƒAƒm‚Ì—ûK‚ğ‚³‚¹‚ç‚ê‚Ü‚µ‚½ - "I was forced to practice the piano by my mother."</p>
<p>”Ş‚Í—F’B‚Éƒr[ƒ‹‚ğ‚½‚­‚³‚ñˆù‚Ü‚¹‚ç‚ê‚½ - "He was forced to drink a lot of beer by his friend."</p>
<p>This pattern is formed by starting with a sentence in the causative form, and then applying the rules in grammar point 1.1 to change the sentence in to the passive form. Though this type of sentence may appear confusing at first, you can make sense of it if you take a look at the words that compose it. The subject, in other words the person who is made or forced to do the action, is marked with ‚Í or ‚ª . The actor, who forces the subject to do something, is marked with ‚É . Direct objects, which are acted on by the subject, are marked by ‚ğ . The verb shows the action that the subject was forced to do, and is in the causative passive form. Below is a table showing how the causative passive form is constructed for several verbs.</p>
