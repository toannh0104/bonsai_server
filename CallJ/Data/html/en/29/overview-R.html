<b>Introduction to the passive form</b></p>
<p>In this lesson we will study the passive and causative passive forms of verbs. The passive form is used to indicate that something was acted upon by someone else, while the causative is used to indicate that someone was made to perform an action by someone else. We will also study some special usages of the passive form, such as sentences that express sympathy for the passive subject or indicate respect towards someone of higher social status.</p>
<p>We will see examples of each of these kinds of expressions.</p>
