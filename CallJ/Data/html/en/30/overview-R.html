<b><i> "Keigo"</i><BR><br>
Introduction to the honorific form</P></b>
<P>


In this lesson we will practise polite language used when talking to those of higher social status. This polite language is called 'keigo' and is crucial for smooth interactions in Japanese society. There are two basic kinds of 'keigo' - honorific language is used for talking about the actions of one's superiors, while humble language is used to talk about the actions of oneself or one's peers. Each verb has both an honorific and humble form. For most verbs these forms are created from simple grammatical rules, but the most common verbs have special honorific and humble equivalents that must be learnt.
