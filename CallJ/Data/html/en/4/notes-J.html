<p>The sentence you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above.  The grammar required to form these sentences is covered in the text below.</p>

<p><u><b>Grammar Point 1: The Standard and Modifier Forms of Adjectives</b></u></p>
<p>Adjectives in Japanese fall into two distinct categories with distinct conjugations based on what the word looks like in the modifier form. The first type of adjective is derived from nouns, and in the standard form they are used in the same way. These adjectives are called "na" adjectives because they always end with "na" when used to modify the noun that follows them.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Standard form of "na" adjectives</td></tr><tr><td>鈴木さんは静かです - "Suzuki is quiet." (Statement)</td></tr><tr><td>田中さんは元気ですか- "Is Tanaka feeling well?" (Question)</td></tr><tr><td>この靴はきれいじゃありません - "These shoes are not clean." (Negative)</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Modifier form of "na" adjectives</td></tr><tr><td>静かな人が好きです - "I like quiet people."</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The second type of adjective ends with "i", so they are referred to as "i" adjectives. The standard form differs from that of "na" adjectives and nouns. The standard form and modifier form for these adjectives are identical.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Standard form of "i" adjectives</td></tr><tr><td>ジョンさんはやさしいです - "John is kind." (Statement)</td></tr><tr><td>英語の本は高かったです - "English books were expensive." (Question)</td></tr><tr><td>このコーヒーは温かくありません - "This coffee is not hot." (Negative)</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Modifier form of "i" adjectives</td></tr><tr><td>おいしいケーキを食べました - "I ate a tasty cake."</td></tr><tr><td>ジョンさんはやさしい人です - "John is a kind person."</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Note that even though some words end in "i", for example きれい ("pretty"), they are actually "na" adjectives!</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>森にきれいな花があります - "There are some pretty flowers in the forest."</p>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 2: Expressing Also</b></u></p>
<p>The marker "mo" expresses similarity between the topic of the current sentence and a topic that was previously discussed or introduced. It is used in place of the topic marker "ha", and conveys its meaning with the additional nuance of "also". It can be used in both statements and questions.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>サリーさんはアメリカ人です - "Sally is American."</p>
<p>サリーさんもアメリカ人です - "Sally is also American."</p>
<p>While both of the sentences describe Sally, the nuance is slightly different. In the first sentence we are simply describing Sally, but the second sentence implies that earlier in the conversation someone mentioned the fact that a different person was American. The second sentence can only be used in this context.</p>
