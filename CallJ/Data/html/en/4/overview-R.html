<p><b><i>"That's a nice cake."</i></b><br>
<b>Introduction to adjectives</b></p>
<p>In this lesson we will practise making simple statements about objects, conveying simple information about the object via the use of adjectives. Two forms of adjective use will be practiced. First, we consider the standard usage where the adjective is located after the noun in question. We also look at the case where an adjective modifies the noun that directly follows it. Finally, this lesson also introduces a further form of the definitive that is used to modify a noun.</p>
