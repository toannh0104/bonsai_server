Introducing the sentence patterns of permission and forbidden<BR></P></b>
<P>

<br>
In this lesson we will practise two sentence patterns.
One is for asking for permission, using the structure verb + ‚Ä ‚à ‚¢‚¢‚©.
The other is to forbid an action, using the structure verb + ‚Ä ‚Í ‚¢‚¯‚È‚¢.
We will look at making sentences in both polite and plain form, using question and statement forms.
The patterns and forms you will be expected to know to complete this lesson are summarized below:<BR><BR>

<table align=CENTER width=600 border=1 style="margin-left: 15%;">

	<tr><td></td><td>‚Ü‚Ç‚ð‚ ‚¯‚Ä‚à‚¢‚¢‚Å‚·‚©</td><td>"Do you mind if I open the window?"(Permission)</td></tr>
	<tr><td></td><td>‚±‚±‚Å‚½‚Î‚±‚ð‚·‚Á‚Ä‚Í‚¢‚¯‚Ü‚¹‚ñ<td>"No smoking here"(Forbidden)</td></tr>
