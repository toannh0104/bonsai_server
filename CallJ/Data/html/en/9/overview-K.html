Expressing reasons and giving explanations<BR></P></b>
<P>

<br>
In this lesson we will practice how to express reasons and explanations. First, we will look at から and ので , which are used to mark a conditional clause as a reason. When these expressions connect two clauses, the first becomes the reason for the second. When a speaker ends a sentence with the のです or the plain form んだ , it indicates that he is giving or asking for an explanation. The explanation is usually based on information that the speaker and listener share. This grammar pattern can also be used to emphasise a point emotionally. Study the following examples.
<BR>

<table align=CENTER width=600 border=1 style="margin-left: 15%;">
<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>1</td><td>Reasons with Kara</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>あついからこーらをのむ。</td><td>Since it's hot, I drink cola.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>2</td><td>Reasons with Node</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>じょんはいそがしいのでさっかーをしない。</td><td>John won't play soccer because he's busy.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>にちようびなのできょうかいへいく。</td><td>Because it's Sunday, I'll go to church.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>3</td><td>Explanation with N-da/desu</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>じょんのかばんはおおきいんです。</td><td>John's bag is big.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>あすじょんにあうんです。</td><td>I'll meet John tomorrow.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>ゆうはんはぴざなんです。</td><td>We're having pizza for dinner.</td></tr>
