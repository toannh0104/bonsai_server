Expressing reasons and giving explanations<BR></P></b>
<P>

<br>In this lesson we will practice how to express reasons and explanations. First, we will look at ‚©‚ç and ‚Ì‚Å , which are used to mark a conditional clause as a reason. When these expressions connect two clauses, the first becomes the reason for the second. When a speaker ends a sentence with the ‚Ì‚Å‚· or the plain form ‚ñ‚¾ , it indicates that he is giving or asking for an explanation. The explanation is usually based on information that the speaker and listener share. This grammar pattern can also be used to emphasise a point emotionally. Study the following examples.
<BR>

<table align=CENTER width=600 border=1 style="margin-left: 15%;">
<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>1</td><td>Reasons with Kara</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Atsui kara kola wo nomu.</td><td>Since it's hot, I drink cola.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>2</td><td>Reasons with Node</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>John ha isogashi node soccer wo shinai.</td><td>John won't play soccer because he's busy</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Nichiyoubi na node kyoukai he iku.</td><td>Because it's Sunday, I'll go to church.</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#AAAAFF"><td width =30>3</td><td>Explanation with N-da/desu</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>John no kaban ha ookii n desu.</td><td>John's bag is big.</td></tr>
