		The sentence you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above.  The grammar required
		to form these sentences is covered in the text below.<br>

<BR><HR><BR><p><font size="4"><u><b>Grammar Point 1: Comparing two things</b></u></font></p>
<p>For comparisons between two things, the expression より is used with an adjective. In this type of sentence, the two objects being compared must be nouns or noun phrases. In this type of sentence, the adjective may be conjugated just as in a simple descriptive sentence. Study the examples below.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>新幹線はバスより高い。</td><td>"The bullet train is more expensive than the bus."</td></tr><tr><td>中国語はフランス語より簡単です。</td><td>"Chinese is easier than French."</td></tr><tr><td>そのレストランは食堂より安かったです。</td><td>"That restaurant was cheaper than the cafeteria."</td></tr><tr><td>妹は姉よりきれいだった。</td><td>"My younger sister was prettier than my older sister."</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size="4"><u><b>Grammar Point 2:  Too much</b></u></font></p>
<p>The verb すぎる can be used as an auxiliary verb suffix for adjectives to express the concept that something is excessive in degree or more than one usually expects. The basic pattern is formed from a simple descriptive statement using an adjective with the copula だ / です , but the construction varies depending on the type of adjective that is used. For "na" adjectives, simply replace the copula with すぎる . For "i" adjectives, drop the final "i" sound and add すぎる . In both cases, the resulting word is a verb that can be conjugated like any other verb.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td width="30">1</td><td>Plain vs Polite</td></tr><tr><td>この本は高すぎます。</td><td>"This book is too expensive."</td></tr><tr><td>この授業の宿題は簡単すぎる。</td><td>"The homework in this class is too easy."</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td width="30">2</td><td>Past</td></tr><tr><td>子供の頃は英語が難しすぎた。</td><td>"English was too difficult when I was a child."</td></tr><tr><td>あのレストランのカレーは辛すぎました。</td><td>"The curry at that restaurant was too spicy."</td></tr>

<p><font size="4"><u><b>Grammar Point 3: Asking Questions about Preferences</b></u></font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>3.1 Which (Two choices)</b></font></p>
<p>For choices between two things, the question word corresponding to 'which' is どちら . The examples below show how to ask someone to choose between two alternatives.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>バニラとチョコレートとどちらが好きですか。</td><td>"Which do you prefer, vanilla or chocolate?"</td></tr><tr><td>うどんとそばとどちらが好きですか。</td><td>"Which do you prefer, udon noodles or soba noodles?"</td></tr><tr><td>どちらが好きですか。</td><td>"Which do you prefer?" (out of two things)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>If the two items are understood from context, then the question can be shortened as in the last example.</p>
<p><font size="4"><b>3.2 Which (More than two choices)</b></font></p>
<p>This pattern is used for asking someone to choose one thing from several choices. This case is identical to the one above, except that a different question word must be used when there are more than two choices. In this case, どれ must be used instead of どちら . In English no distinction is made between these two cases so both words translate to 'which (one)', but in Japanese you must pay attention to the number of choices and select the appropriate word. Study the examples below. As in the previous case, the last example shows how the question can be shortened if the choices can be understood from context.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>ハンバーガーとホットドッグとステーキとどちらが好きですか。</td><td>"Which do you prefer, hamburgers, hot dogs, or steak?"</td></tr><tr><td>どれが好きですか。</td><td>"Which do you prefer?" (out of more than two things)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Adding a noun phrase followed by のなかで can be used to limit the range of possible choices to those described by the noun phrase. For example, the first example sentence could be used at a restaurant where there are many kinds of sushi on display.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>このお寿司のなかでどれが好きですか。</td><td>"Which kind of sushi do you prefer out of these?"</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size="4"><b>3.3 What (More than two choices)</b></font></p>
<p>Similar to the grammar pattern introduced in 3.2, this grammar pattern is used for questions where more than one choice is available. However, this type of question allows the listener to choose more than one thing in their answer. As before, a noun phrase plus のなかで can be used to limit the choices to a particular set. In the example below the listener chooses two things in his answer, though he could have chosen only one thing as well.</p>
<p>日本料理のなかで何が好きですか。	  "Among Japanese foods, which ones do you like?"</p>
<p>天ぷらととんかつが好きです。	  "I like tempura and tonkatsu."</p>
