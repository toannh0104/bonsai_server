<p><b><i>"I wanted to learn English."</i></b><br>
<b>Expressing intentions and desires</b></p>
<p>In this lesson, you will practise how to express intentions and desires. We will consider a new verb form, the "tai" form, which is used to express whether or not a speaker intends to perform an action. This form can be used in both statements and questions, but we will also examine how to use its positive and negative forms, as well as its past and non-past forms. We will also see how this form changes depending on whether the sentence is polite or plain. The forms you will be expected to know to complete this lesson are summarised below.</p>
