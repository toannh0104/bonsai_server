<p>The sentences you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above. The grammar required to form these sentences is covered in the text below.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 1: Listing subjects and objects with "ya"</b></u></p>
<p>You have already studied the list marker "to", which translates as the English word "and" and is used to give a complete list of nouns as the subject or direct object of a sentence. The incomplete list marker "ya" is similar, but it implies some other nouns are not mentioned in the sentence.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>コーラとお茶を飲みました - "I drank cola and tea."</p>
<p>コーラやお茶を飲みました - "I drank cola, tea, and other things."</p>
<p>In the first sentence in the example above, the speaker is only talking about cola and tea. But in the second sentence, the implication is that the speaker drank many things but is only mentioning two of them.</p>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 2: The "tari" form of verbs</b></u></p>
<p>When enumerating an incomplete list of actions, a form of the verb called the "tari" form is used. Each action mentioned is put into the "tar" form, and the verb "suru" is added to the end of the sentence. The "tari" form of verbs is constructed by adding a "ri" sound to the end of the plain past tense. The tense of the sentence is determined by the "suru" at the end.</p>

<p><b>2.1 Listing phrases and actions</b></p>
<p>When the "tari" form of verbs is used to enumerate a few actions out of a larger list, it performs the same function that "ya" does for nouns. In other words, it indicates that there were additional actions which were not mentioned in the sentence. No relative order of the actions is implied.</p>
<p>週末はテレビを見たり本を読んだりします - "On weekends I watch TV, read books, and so on."</p>
<p>学校で友達と話したり勉強したりします - "At school I talk to my friends, study, and do other things."</p>
<p><b>2.2 Listing predicates</b></p>
<p>The "tari" form is also used to describe alternating states or repeating actions done by the same subject. This usage carries the nuance that sometimes the subject is or does one thing, and at other times it is or does something else.</p>
<p>勝負で勝ったり負けたりする - "Sometimes I win games and sometimes I lose."</p>
<p>バスは来たり来なかったりします - "Sometimes the bus comes and sometimes it doesn't."</p>
