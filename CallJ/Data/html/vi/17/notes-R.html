<p>The sentences you create in this lesson should all be similar to the forms shown above. The grammar required to form these sentences is covered in the text below.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 1: Recommendations and preferences</b></u></p>
<p><b>1.1 Recommendations</b></p>
<p>First, we will look at an expression used to give advice or recommendations to others. This expression corresponds to the phrase "You should ..." in English, and is a polite way to recommend that someone should do something. Study the following examples.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>–¾“ú‹“s‚És‚Á‚½•û‚ª‚¢‚¢‚Å‚· - "You should go to Kyoto tomorrow."</p>
<p>‰pŒê‚ğ•×‹­‚µ‚½•û‚ª‚¢‚¢‚Å‚· - "You should study English."</p>
<p>In this expression, the plain past form of the verb that shows the action to be done is followed by "hou ga ii desu". For the plain form, the "desu" at the end of the sentence can be dropped.</p>
<p><b>1.2 Preferences</b></p>
<p>The expression we looked at in the last section can actually be used to show a preference for one thing when comparing two or more things. This expression is used when the speaker has a choice between two or more alternatives. In this case, instead of the plain past form of a verb, we use a noun directly followed by the marker "no". Here are a few examples.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>ƒsƒU‚Ì•û‚ª‚¢‚¢‚Å‚· - "Pizza would be better."</p>
<p>‚±‚Ì–{‚Ì•û‚ª‚¢‚¢‚Å‚· - "This book is better."</p>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 2: Expressing obligations</b></u></p>
<p>To express that someone must do something, the following expression is used. It corresponds to the expressions "must" or "have to" in English, and is used to describe both external obligations placed on the subject by someone else or the speaker's convictions about what needs to be done. To form this expression, change the plain negative form of the verb into the "ba" form and add the negative form of the verb "naru".</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>h‘è‚ğo‚³‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î‚È‚ç‚È‚¢ - "You have to turn in your homework." (plain)</p>
<p>¡“ú‚Í‘‚­‹A‚ç‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î‚È‚è‚Ü‚¹‚ñ - "I must go home early today." (polite)</p>
<p><b>2.1 The negative "ba" form of verbs</b></p>
<p>The negative "ba" form of verbs is used in the expression above, but it can also be used to make conditional statements like the normal "ba" form. This kind of sentence describes the result that occurs if the action in the conditional clause is not performed. To construct this form, the final "i" sound of the plain negative form is replaced with "kereba". See the examples below.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td>Group</td><td>English</td><td>Dictionary Form</td><td>Plain negative</td><td>Negative "ba" form</td></tr><tr><td width="30">1</td><td>To go</td><td>s‚­</td><td>s‚©‚È‚¢</td><td>s‚©‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>To drink</td><td>ˆù‚Ş</td><td>ˆù‚Ü‚È‚¢</td><td>ˆù‚Ü‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>To play</td><td>—V‚Ô</td><td>—V‚Î‚È‚¢</td><td>—V‚Î‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î</td></tr><tr><td width="30">2</td><td>To sleep</td><td>Q‚é</td><td>Q‚È‚¢</td><td>Q‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>To eat</td><td>H‚×‚é</td><td>H‚×‚È‚¢</td><td>H‚×‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>To watch</td><td>Œ©‚é</td><td>Œ©‚È‚¢</td><td>Œ©‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î</td></tr><tr><td width="30">3</td><td>To come</td><td>—ˆ‚é</td><td>—ˆ‚È‚¢</td><td>—ˆ‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>To do</td><td>‚·‚é</td><td>‚µ‚È‚¢</td><td>‚µ‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î</td></tr>

<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>Ø•„‚ğ”ƒ‚í‚È‚¯‚ê‚Î“dÔ‚Éæ‚ê‚Ü‚¹‚ñ - "If you don't buy a ticket, you can't ride the train."</p>
<p>–¾“ú‰J‚ª~‚ç‚È‚¯‚ê‚Îs‚¯‚Ü‚· - "It it doesn't rain tomorrow, I can go."</p>
<p><u><b>Grammar Point 3: Giving permission and making suggestions</b></u></p>
<p>Finally, we will look at another expression used to give permission. This expression gives permission to do the specified action and suggests that it will be enough for the situation. It carries the nuance that other choices are also acceptable. It is similar to the expressions "You can just..." or "It will be fine if you..." in English.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<p>æ¶‚É•·‚¢‚½‚ç‚¢‚¢‚Å‚· - "Just ask the professor."</p>
<p>ƒX[ƒc‚ğ’…‚½‚ç‚¢‚¢‚Å‚· - "You can just wear a suit."</p>
<p>Remember that a sentence that uses the "te" form of the verb followed by "mo ii desu" gives permission to do the specified action. In this case, the focus is on the permission only. In contrast, a sentence using the "tara" form of a verb followed by "ii desu" is more of a suggestion that implies permission. This expression is often used when giving advice or recommending a course of action.</p>
