<b>Recommendations, rules, and suggestions</b></p>
<p>In this lesson we will cover expressions used for giving recommendations and expressing preference for one thing over another. We will also see how to express situations where the speaker or listener must do something. Finally, we will learn an expression for giving the listener permission to do something without specifying the details. The main forms to be practised in this lesson can be summarised by the following examples.</p>
