<p><b><i>"Five stamps"</i></b><br>
<b>Using counters to count objects</b></p>
<p>In this lesson we will look at how to use counters in Japanese. Counters are used to count objects, and the form of the counter may vary depending on the type of object. For example, one type of counter is used for long, thin objects (–{: 1 pencil is counted as ˆê–{), whereas another is used for counting flat objects (–‡: 1 sheet of paper would be counted as ˆê–‡). The following table shows the different forms that your answer may take during this lesson:</p>
<table align="center" width="600" border="1" style="margin-left: 15%;">
