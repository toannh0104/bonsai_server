Expressing hope and relief<BR></b></P>
<P>

<br>In this lesson we will practise expressions for showing the speaker's opinion on past and future events. The first expression we will study is similar to 'I hope...' in English and expresses the speaker's hope for the outcome of an event in the future. Finally, we will study expressions used to express regret and satisfaction for past events.
