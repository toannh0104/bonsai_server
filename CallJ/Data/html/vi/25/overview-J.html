Expressions with subordinate clauses<BR></b></P>
<P>

<br>
This lesson focuses on expressions that use subordinate clauses marked by the particle "と". You can think of subordinate clauses as small sentences that are embedded in a larger sentence. We will practice expressions that use a subordinate clause to express what someone says or thinks. We will also learn an expression that describes or explains a noun without using a subordinate clause.
