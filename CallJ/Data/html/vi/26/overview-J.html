Expressions with concessions<BR></b></P>
<P>

<br>
In this lesson we will learn how to make expressions with concessions. In both grammar patterns that we will practise, the main sentence describing the result is preceded by another sentence that sets down conditions on the outcome. In the first pattern, the result is not what the speaker expected given the concession. In the second pattern, the statement holds even allowing for the concession.
