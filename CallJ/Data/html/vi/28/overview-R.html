<b><i> "The teacher made the student read a book"</i></b><BR>
<b>Compulsion, permission, and requests with the causative form<BR></P></b>
<P>

<br>
In this lesson we will look at the construction and use of the causative form.  This is typically used to
convey the meaning of compulsion, i.e. someone being compelled to do something.  However, the same
form may also be used to convey someone being allowed to do a particular action.  Also, combined with
"Kudasai" (please), it may be used to ask permission to do an action.<BR><BR>
