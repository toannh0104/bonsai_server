		<content lang="ja_JP">In this lesson we will practise grammar patterns used to express whether an event has already happened or not. まだ is used to show that an action is still ongoing, or that an event has not yet happened. In contrast, もう is used to show that an event has already occurred or than an action has finished. Finally, the expression までに can be used to show that an event will be completed before a certain time. All of these expressions can be used with both volitional actions initiated by the speaker or events outside of the speaker's control.</content>

<p>Grammar Point 1:</p>
<p>The expression まだ shows that something is in the same state as it was previously. The main idea is that the state being described has not changed between some time in the past and the time when the statement is made. In most cases the equivalent English expression is 'still,' although for negative sentences 'yet' is also used.</p>

Positive sentences</td></tr><tr><td>コーラはまだありますか。</td><td>"Do you still have cola?"</td></tr><tr><td>太郎はまだ勉強しています。</td><td>"Taro is still studying."</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#aaaaff"><td colspan="2">2. Negative sentences</td></tr><tr><td>宿題はまだやっていません。</td><td>"I haven't done my homework yet."</td></tr><tr><td>まだ東京に行ったことがない。</td><td>"I still haven't been to Tokyo."</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Grammar Point 2:</p>
<p>You can think of もう as the opposite of まだ because it expresses a change in state between some point in the past and the time the statement is made. Often, the nuance is that the action has been completed or stopped. In positive sentences もう is usually translated as 'already,' and in negative sentences as 'not anymore' or 'no longer.'</p>

<p>Grammar Point 3:</p>
<p>The grammar pattern までに is used to express that an event will complete by a certain time in the future. It expresses a time limit for the event in question, but it allows for the possibility that the event will complete before the specified time. Note that までに cannot be used with verbs that express a continuous state, such as いる or 待つ .</p>
