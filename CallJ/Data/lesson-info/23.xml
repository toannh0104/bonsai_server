<p><font size="4"><u><b>Grammar Point 1: Hope</b></u></font></p>
<p>The first grammar pattern we will study expresses the speaker's hope about the outcome of an uncontrollable event that has not yet occurred, and is similar to the English expression 'It would be nice if...'. In this grammar pattern a subordinate clause in the plain non-past form is followed by といい . In this lesson we will study subordinate clauses with verbs, though adjectives and the copula may also be used in this pattern.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>弟も来るといいです。</td><td>"I hope my little brother will come, too."</td></tr><tr><td>日本語が上手になるといい。</td><td>"It would be nice if your Japanese gets better."</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size="4"><u><b>Grammar Point 2: Regret</b></u></font></p>
<p>This grammar pattern expresses the speaker's regret for something that was not done in the past. The nuance is that the outcome would have been better than the current one if the specified action had been done. This expression is similar to 'I should have...' or 'I wish I had...' in English. In this pattern a conditional clause with the "ba" form of a verb is followed by よかった , the past tense of the adjective いい . If the subject of the clause is omitted (as in the examples in this lesson), then it is understood to be the speaker.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>もっと英語を勉強すればよかったです。</td><td>"I should have studied English more."</td></tr><tr><td>お茶を買えばよかった。</td><td>"I wish I had bought some tea."</td></tr>
</table>
<p><font size="4"><u><b>Grammar Point 3: Satisfaction</b></u></font></p>
<p>This grammar pattern consists of a clause with the "te" form of a verb followed by よかった , the past tense of the adjective いい , and is used to express the speaker's relief or satisfaction about an event in the past. The equivalent English expressions are 'I'm glad that...' or 'It was good that...' . Like the second grammar point this pattern is used to evaluate a past event, although in this case the event must have actually taken place. When the speaker is talking about himself (as in the examples in this lesson), the subject of the clause can be omitted.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>あの本を読んでよかった。</td><td>"I'm glad I read that book."</td></tr><tr><td>車を買ってよかったです。</td><td>"I'm glad that I bought a car."</td></tr>
