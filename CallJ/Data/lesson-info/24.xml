<p><font size="4"><u><b>Grammar Point 1: Ease and Difficulty</b></u></font></p>
<p>In this lesson we will cover two grammar patterns used to express how easy or difficult an action is to perform. These expressions most often carry the nuance of physical difficulty or ease rather than mental. To express that something is difficult, add the suffix にくい to the stem form of a verb. To express that something is easy, add the suffix やすい to the stem form of a verb. In both cases, adding the suffix changes the verb into an "i" adjective that can be conjugated like any other "i" adjective. Study the examples below.</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" border="1">
<tr><td>この靴は走りにくいです。</td><td>"It's hard to run with these shoes."</td></tr><tr><td>あの大学は入りにくい。</td><td>"That university is hard to get into."</td></tr><tr><td>彼の名前は覚えやすいです。</td><td>"His name is easy to remember."</td></tr><tr><td>このシャツは洗いやすい。</td><td>"This shirt is easy to wash."</td></tr>
