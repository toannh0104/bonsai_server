			The Grammar Form shows us that we are talking about a person, and that the answer must

		<gfxHelp>
			In this type of question you are asked to make a declarative statement or question about a person.
			Your answer may be a question about the person's nationality (for example, "Is Anne British?"), 
			or specify their job ("My brother is a doctor."). Please check the Grammar Form to 
			determine what form your response should be in.

			We can see that Sally is the subject (marked with S), and that we
			are being asked to comment on whether she is British (information,
			marked with I).  In this case she is not, as is indicated by the cross in
			the diagram.

			You are sitting at a table opposite your friend.  If the object
			is closer to you, i.e. in the lower half of the table, it is refered 
			to as "this".  For example, "This is a pen". If it is closer to your friend, you should refer to it as "that".  
			For example, "Is that a bag?". When two objects are shown which are the same, your description of the
			selected object should include the word "also".  For example, "Is that also a CD?".
		</gfxHelp>
		<diagHelp>
			The object, a map, is closer to you and thus addressed as "This". 
			You are asked to form a question, and the question you would be
			expected to ask (in Japanese) is, "Is this a map?"

			There are two objects, but the focus is on the one further from
			you, so you should refer to it as "that". As there are two identical objects,
			you must use the word "also" in your answer,  i.e. "That is also..."
